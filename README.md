  Clatter V1.0.0
</h1>

<p align="center">
  Clatter is a communication platform for workspaces and is made by a small team by the name of Quntem. This project was made because of High Seas, a Hack Club program. Clatter is a successor to TeamSpace which was highly successful for the High Seas program.

<h2 align="center">
  V1.0.0
</h2>

<p align="center">
  Version 1.0.0 of Clatter is the first version of Clatter and might probably be the last depending on how much time we have left on High Seas. We may or may not abandon the project in the future after High Seas depending on how much support we gain from this! If you want to support us, you can head on over and star our project!
